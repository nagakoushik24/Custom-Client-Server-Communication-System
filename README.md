# ðŸ”— ICN-Based Client-Server Communication System

This project implements a simplified **Information-Centric Networking (ICN)** architecture using a Python-based client-server model. It simulates data-centric communication, showcasing how ICN focuses on *what* data is requested rather than *where* it is stored.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Developed a **custom ICN communication protocol** for content identification.
- Built using Python's socket programming for real-time network emulation.
- Supports content request and delivery between client and server over a simulated ICN layer.
- Educational prototype for understanding ICN concepts and caching strategies.
